# ParkingEmulatorTask
Simply C# task for parking emulation

To run it you will need [**Visual Studio**](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).  
To implement web part of this solution I used ASP.NET CORE WebApi technology.  
If you have any suqqestions how to make it better - feel free to contact me.

Hope, you will like it!
